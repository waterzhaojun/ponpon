# Step 0
frameRate: 1 # Temporal resolution. Second per frame
spatialRes: 1 # Spatial resolution. um per pixel
regMaskGap: 4 # Exclude pixels shorter than this distance to border

# Step 1: Signal -- Active voxels
thrARScl: 35 # Intensity threshold scaling factor. 
# when I set to 14, some obverous event missed.
smoXY: 2 # Smoothing (sigma) As I already smoothed the movie previously, there is no difference between 1 and 4
minSize: 20 # Minimum size (pixels)

# Step 2: Voxel -- Super voxels
zThr: 20 # Voxels temporal cut threshold. It is explained in step 4 as delta tw.
thrExtZ: 35 # Growing z threshold. z is representing correlation, explained in step 4.


# Step 3: Event -- Super events and events
cRise: 2 # Rising time uncertainty. Explained in step 5. super voxels can not consider as one event if rising time bigger than threshold.
cDelay: 2 # Slowest delay in propagation
gtwSmo: 2 # Propagation smoothness

# Step 4: Clean -- False positive control  # Z score threshold (default is 2). It is explained in step 4 as z-score threshold for correlation.

# Step 5: Merge -- Merging
ignoreMerge: 1 # Ignore merging. 1 means check
mergeEventDiscon: 0 # Maximum distance
mergeEventCorr: 0 # Minimum correlation
mergeEventMaxTimeDif: 2 # Maximum time difference

# Step 6: Recon -- Reconstruct after merging # Temporally extend events (defualt is 0 means uncheck)
extendEvtRe: 0 # Not sure it is this parameter

# Step 7: Fea -- Feature extraction
ignoreTau: 1 # Ignore delay Tau
